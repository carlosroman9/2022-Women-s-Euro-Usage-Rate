Description: Over the last two years women’s football has exploded in popularity starting with FC Barcelona Femini’s record breaking match attendance of 91,648 people. Recently, the  BBC reported that the organization, Women Sport Trust (WST) discovered that the average viewer watched, “8 hours and 44 minutes of women’s sport in 2022,” while only “3 hours and 47 minutes were watched in 2021.” WST also found that a group of people only watched women’s sport and not men’s. The BBC cites “8.4 million people watched the FA Women’s Super League only did not tune in to the Premier League.” The increase in viewership of women’s football suggests an increase in popularity of the sport and leads one to consider the implications of women’s football reaching mainstream success. However, I believe that one barrier of entry for many people to engage in the sport is knowledge of the players. Who are the players to watch? Who is the “Lebron James” of women’s football?


Goal: 
My goal with this project was to give an average viewer of women’s soccer a deeper understanding of player performance through the metric of “usage rate.” Usage rate has been traditionally used in Basketball to assess player performance. It provides insight into  how much of the ball is used by a particular player. Usage may include a player’s shots, dribbles, key passes, and possessions lost. The player’s “uses” are then divided by the entire team’s “uses” (the total amount of all the players on the team’s uses) to determine the usage rate. Though many sports fans may simply look at baskets/goals, conversion rate, and assists to determine who the star offensive players are, those stats alone may not illustrate the true magnificence of a player’s performance. For example, two players may share an identical shot conversion rate of 75%. Further examination reveals that Player A completed 3 out of 4 shots, while Player B completed 75 out of 100 shots. All of a sudden the two players seem vastly different. Furthermore, this difference would be reflected in their usage rates, as Player B would have a higher usage rate than Player A because they had a higher “use” of the ball (100 total shots vs 4 total shots). I was inspired to pursue this project because of my interest in human performance and personnel recruitment. I also became interested in this type of analysis because of Brentford FC, a London based soccer club playing in England’s highest soccer division; the Premier League. Until two seasons ago, they were playing second in a second division league, but after embracing a data driven approach to player recruitment they achieved promotion and have stayed in Premier League since. I also took inspiration from a youtube channel called, Tifo Football, where they did their own version of usage rate analysis for their male players. 


Process: 
First, I found an open source database on Github called “,Stats Bomb” that is dedicated to soccer stats. From there, I needed to define my “usage rate” formula. Since usage rate is primarily used in Basketball, I came up with a simplified version of the formula based on the explanations from Tifo Football. I defined my usage rate formula as : goals + assists + chances created + incomplete dribbles + completed dribbles + shots + mis-controls + dispossessions/ team goals + team assists + team chances created + team completed dribbles + team incomplete dribbles + team shots + team miscontrols + team dispossessions. I also calculated another measure called, positive rate, which is all the positive use from the player (shots, assists, chances, goals) divided by the player’s usage rate. 
	After defining my formula I parsed through the data using python. The python script was designed to open a list of links, all of which were the events for all the matches in Euro 2022. The program then read the JSON data and parsed through it and collected the data trees that I wanted like the specific event names (shots, dribbles, dispossessions), player names, team names, minute count in the match, and play patterns. After the data was extracted, I placed it into a SQLite database that divided into different tables depending on the event name. I then exported the tables into csv files that I imported into SQL Server. From there, I conducted my SQL analysis. I cleaned and manipulated the data by using CASE statements to create columns with specific data, such as extracting “passess leading to shots” from the outcomes column in the passess table and creating an “chances created” column. After formatting the data, I created a Common Table Expression for each table and joined the CTE’s together by team and player name to account for the fact that not all players and teams were included in all tables. The joining of the tables created NULL values in some columns in which I used UPDATE to change all NULL values to return the number 0. I then used my usage rate and positive rate formula and added the necessary columns together. After ensuring my calculations looked correct, I created a view with the  usage rate, positive rate, team, and player columns. Finally, I exported my query as a csv and imported it to Power Bi to create a scatter plot. 

Results:
Most players in the tournament fell in the middle of the scatter plot, however, there were some stand out players in both ends of the positive rate and usage rate spectrums. Karolina Vilhjalmsdottir was the player with the highest usage rate at almost 25%; this signifies that this player was constantly trying to create offensive opportunities with the ball (dribbling against players, shooting, creating score chances, etc). On the other hand, Jill Scott was a player who did not have many offensive plays with the ball and showed a lack of ball possession and a more defensive play style. In terms of positive rate, Millie Bright stands out at about an 80% positive rate while having less than 5% usage rate. This suggests that while Bright did not possess much of the ball, the times that she did ended up scoring chances for her team or contributed to goals herself. Alternatively, Ria Oling had above 15% usage rate of the ball, but had about a 10% positive rate, indicating that while she possessed the ball significantly, her uses of the ball were not positive (lost dribbles, and was dispossessed of the ball). 

Overall, analyzing usage rate and positive rate amongst players presents a clearer image of the player’s individual and team effectiveness beyond simply gazing at goals and assists. It presents a holistic view of a player's contributions to their team.
